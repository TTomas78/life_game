# life_game

To use the game just only set the initial_status.py with the value as you decide. Just check that all elements in the matrix have values (1 or 0)

After that, execute the life_game.py

note: The number of iterations is hardcoded in 10. That value can be changed modifing life_game.py

Soon I will add history and a more friendly way to set the initial configuration
